# Changelog

## Unreleased — MCode custom providers preserve model token limits

MCode agents now accept `context_window` and `max_output_tokens` agent kwargs
and write them into the generated custom-provider model configuration. The
known `minimax/MiniMax-M3` model inherits its 512K context and 128K output
limits when those kwargs are omitted, instead of silently falling back to
MCode's generic 200K context and 16K output defaults.

## Unreleased — `--plugin-kwarg` can target one of several `--plugin` values

`--plugin-kwarg` (`--pk`) now accepts `PLUGIN.key=value`, where `PLUGIN` is the literal value of one of the `--plugin` options (short name or import path; longest match wins). The kwarg binds only to that plugin, so `--pk` works with multiple `--plugin` options. Kwargs without a matching prefix keep the previous rule: they require exactly one `--plugin`.

## Unreleased — Egress-control kernel probe no longer skipped on Linux clients

`DockerEnvironment` decided whether the daemon kernel supports the egress-control sidecar's `fib daddr type local` nftables rules by first checking `sys.platform == "linux"`, which short-circuited the probe entirely. The probe runs `docker container run`, so it measures the *daemon's* kernel, while `sys.platform` describes the *client*. Whenever the two differ — Harbor running inside a Linux container against a mounted Docker Desktop socket, Docker Desktop on Linux, or a remote `DOCKER_HOST` — `network_mode = "allowlist"` and `"no-network"` were accepted against kernels that cannot enforce them, and the sidecar died with an opaque `dependency failed to start`.

The probe now always runs when a restricted network policy is requested. Unsupported daemons are rejected up front with `network_mode=... is not supported by EnvironmentType.DOCKER environment.` instead of failing during container startup. `network_mode = "public"` still never probes, and the result is cached per process.

## Unreleased — TensorLake supports `allowlist` network policies

The TensorLake environment now enforces `network_mode = "allowlist"` in addition to `no-network`. `allowed_hosts` entries map onto the sandbox's `allow_out` egress rules, which accept exact hostnames, IPv4 address literals, and IPv4 CIDR ranges; DNS stays reachable so hostname entries can resolve, and an empty allowlist denies all egress. Wildcard hostnames and IPv6 targets are rejected at validation time — TensorLake's rules cannot express them. The policy is applied when the sandbox is created and cannot be changed afterwards, so `[agent]` and `[verifier]` phase overrides remain unsupported; `[environment]` and `[verifier.environment]` baselines both work.

## Unreleased — Task and dataset package versions

Task and dataset package metadata now include `[task].version` and `[dataset].version`. New tasks and datasets are initialized to `"1.0.0"`; legacy files without a version remain unversioned. Semantic versions are recommended, but Harbor accepts any non-empty version string. Task package versions are distinct from the top-level `schema_version`, which is now `"1.4"` and identifies the `task.toml` format.

## Unreleased — Claude Code subagent transcripts included in trajectories

Newer Claude Code versions write each subagent's transcript to its own JSONL file under a `subagents/` subdirectory instead of inlining sidechain events in the main session file. The trajectory converter only read the main session files, so subagent steps — and their token usage — were silently missing from `trajectory.json` and from the trial's token totals. The converter now reads `subagents/*.jsonl` too: subagent steps appear in chronological order marked with `extra.is_sidechain`, their tokens count toward `final_metrics`, and the root `agent.model_name` keeps preferring the main chain so a subagent on a different model can't be mistaken for the trajectory's primary model. Sidechain steps (including old-format inline ones) are no longer reordered ahead of the main conversation, so the first user step remains the task instruction.

## Unreleased — Removed the legacy `harbor leaderboard` command

The old `harbor leaderboard` CLI (submit + validation flow) and the `harbor.leaderboard` package are gone, superseded by curated leaderboards on Harbor Hub. Use `harbor hub leaderboard` (aliases: `harbor hub lb`, `harbor hub leaderboards`) instead.

Curated leaderboard owners can now export and update definitions and manage rows
with `harbor hub leaderboard export|update` and dedicated
`leaderboard row create|show|list|export|update|delete` commands.
`leaderboard create --rows` can include initial rows. Combined definition and
row migrations validate and commit atomically, with `--dry-run` support. Row
trial associations are managed explicitly with `row trial
list|set|add|remove`. Leaderboard reads return `n_trials`, while `row trial
list` provides paginated access to the trial IDs.

## Unreleased — Hub auth uses personal API keys instead of sessions

`harbor auth login` now mints a long-lived personal API key (`sk-harbor-...`) and stores it in `~/.harbor/credentials.json`, replacing the previous GoTrue session (access + refresh token). Every request authenticates with a short-lived JWT exchanged from the key, so concurrent Harbor processes no longer race on refresh-token rotation — the cause of the constant surprise logouts.

**Migration**: existing logins are not carried over. Run `harbor auth login` once after upgrading (`harbor auth status` will prompt you). CI/scripting via `HARBOR_API_KEY` is unchanged and still takes precedence over the stored login.

Also new:

- `harbor auth key list` / `harbor auth key revoke <key>` manage your personal API keys from the CLI.
- `harbor auth logout` revokes this machine's key server-side; if revocation cannot be confirmed (e.g. offline), the local login is kept so you can retry.
- Re-running `harbor auth login` revokes the key it replaces, so repeated logins don't accumulate live credentials.
- The local viewer's sign-in uses the same key-based flow.

For programmatic consumers: `harbor.auth.session`, `harbor.auth.handler`, and `harbor.auth.api_key` are gone. Use `harbor.auth.client.create_authenticated_client()` / `require_user_id()` and `harbor.auth.tokens.get_access_token()`; auth failures raise typed `harbor.auth.errors.NotAuthenticatedError` / `AuthenticationError` instead of bare `RuntimeError`.

## Unreleased — Job Plugins Are CLI-Only

Job plugin declarations are no longer part of `JobConfig` or persisted in job `config.json`. Historic config files with `plugins` still load, but the key is ignored with a deprecation warning; pass plugins at run/resume time with repeatable `--plugin` and use `--plugin-kwarg` only with one plugin.

## 2026-06-29 — Trial Hook Event trial_name & trial_id Consistency

Breaking: `TrialHookEvent.trial_id` now functions as the actual trial ID and returns the trial result UUID (`result.id`), not the human-readable trial name string. Add two computed_field properties inside `TrialHookEvent`: `trial_name` and `trial_id`.
Breaking: `LogEntry.trial_id` now functions as the actual trial ID and returns the trial UUID, not the human-readable trial name string.
Originally across the harbor core codebase, `TrialHookEvent.trial_id` actually refers to the human-readable trial name string, now we make them consistent across the system to actually use `TrialHookEvent.trial_name` as the variable names whenever used. and update the corresponding helper function names.
Also make the `result: TrialResult` a required attribute in `TrialHookEvent` as it is always provided during construction.

## 2026-06-24 — Runtime identity fields

New identity fields should follow this convention:

- `*_id`: a globally unique, opaque, durable identifier used to link records across systems, such as a UUID or content hash. Designed to be durable. Examples: `environment_id: 425d7b96c096232dc51df2112a68bea5`, `context_id: 594025f3-7d65-4655-8576-4bee95002eae`.
- `*_name`: a human-readable, semantic handle, generally unique within a trial or job and primarily useful while inspecting a run. Designed to be ephemeral. Examples: `environment_name: hello-world`, `session_id: hello-world__bZZeEkw__env`. `session_id` would normally be called `session_name` under this convention, but remains a legacy exception for backward compatibility.

What changed:

- `BaseEnvironment` and `BaseAgent` gained `context_id`, a globally unique join key linking an environment and agent to the same run; today it is the trial `_id`, but later may point to something else, hence the more generic name.
- `session_id` remains the semantic per-instance handle for backward compatibility. It is an explicit legacy exception to the naming convention and now includes a role suffix: `{trial_name}__env`, `{trial_name}__agent`, or `{trial_name}__verifier__<key>`.
- `BaseEnvironment.environment_id` is a 32-character SHA-256 hash of the environment directory contents, with no semantic prefix and no `dirhash` dependency.
- The local Docker image tag is now content-addressed (`hb__{environment_id}`): unchanged environment content reuses the cached image, and different setups of the same task no longer clobber a single per-task tag.

### Backward compatibility

- Sandbox providers continue receiving and using `session_id` unchanged. Orchestration attaches `context_id` after construction, so factories, providers, and custom-agent constructors do not need to accept the new field.

## 2026-06-18 — Harborized `check` and `analyze`

`harbor check` and `harbor analyze` now run as Harbor trials (assemble → `harbor run` → extract) instead of in-process Claude Agent SDK calls, so both run in any Harbor environment via `-e` and produce real trial artifacts.

- `harbor check` ([#1924](https://github.com/harbor-framework/harbor/pull/1924)) validates the agent's rubric output in the verifier; reward 1.0 means a valid, complete check was produced. The per-criterion pass/fail table is the deliverable.

  ```bash
  harbor check examples/tasks/hello-world -e daytona
  ```

- `harbor analyze` ([#1984](https://github.com/harbor-framework/harbor/pull/1984)) writes `analysis.json` back to the analyzed trials/jobs, producing a per-trial `analysis.json` and an aggregated job-level `analysis.json` (rendered by the viewer).

  ```bash
  harbor analyze trials/<trial-or-job-dir> -e daytona
  ```

Because both now run as real Harbor jobs (the old in-process commands ran host-only), they inherit `harbor run`'s flags:

- `-e/--env` + `--ek/--environment-kwarg` — run on any provider (docker, daytona, modal, …) instead of host-only.
- `-a/--agent`, `-m/--model`, `--ak/--agent-kwarg`, `--ae/--agent-env` — pick the evaluator agent/model and pass it kwargs and env vars.
- `-n/--n-concurrent` + `-k/--n-attempts` — parallelize and repeat across trials.
- `-c/--config` — supply a base `JobConfig` (YAML/JSON) for advanced settings.
- `--job-name`, `-o/--jobs-dir`, `-q/--quiet` — standard job output controls.

`harbor check` also batch-filters tasks (`-i/--include-task-name`, `-x/--exclude-task-name`, `-l/--n-tasks`); `harbor analyze` filters trials (`--passing`, `--failing`, `-l/--n-trials`).

Both commands need the model API key and the environment API key exported in the same terminal where you run them:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
export DAYTONA_API_KEY=...
harbor check examples/tasks/hello-world -e daytona
```

---

## Unreleased — Sidecar Artifacts and Collect Hooks

Artifacts can now be collected from Docker Compose sidecar services, so separate verifiers can score from evidence the agent's container never had write access to (request logs, database dumps, runtime counters). Artifact entries gain a `service` field, and `[[verifier.collect]]` hooks run snapshot commands inside services after the agent finishes.

```toml
artifacts = [{ source = "/var/log/api/requests.log", service = "api" }]

[[verifier.collect]]
service = "api"
command = "curl -s localhost:8000/stats > /tmp/stats.json"
```

Supported on every compose-capable provider (docker, daytona, modal, islo, gke, novita, langsmith). Tasks declaring sidecar artifacts or collect hooks on providers without compose support fail at trial start.

### Breaking Changes

#### Trial hook event values use hyphens

Serialized `TrialEvent` values now use hyphens instead of underscores for multi-word lifecycle events: `environment-start`, `agent-start`, `agent-end`, and `verification-start`. Code comparing `event.value` strings should update from the old underscore forms.

#### Trial artifacts directory layout

The host-side layout of `<trial_dir>/artifacts/` changed to mirror each artifact's absolute container source path under a single flat `artifacts/` base dir shared by every service. Source-derived entries from any service (main or sidecar) land at `artifacts/<abs source path>` (e.g. `/var/log/api/requests.log` -> `artifacts/var/log/api/requests.log`); the conventional publish dir (`/logs/artifacts/`) lands at `artifacts/logs/artifacts/`; entries with an explicit `destination` are unchanged (still relative to the artifacts root). `manifest.json` records the originating `service` for every entry. Anything consuming the old basename layout should read `manifest.json` instead of assuming paths.

Verifier-side placement is **unchanged**: artifacts still re-materialize at their original absolute source paths ("no translation"), and `/logs/artifacts/` still maps to `/logs/artifacts/`.

#### Artifact path validation

`destination` values must now be relative paths without `..` components or backslashes, and may not shadow the reserved `manifest.json`. Absolute destinations (previously silently re-rooted) are rejected. Artifact `source` values may no longer contain `..` components (previously accepted). Together these fix a path traversal where a crafted `source` or `destination` could write outside the trial directory on the host.

#### Artifact collision validation

Artifact sets are now validated at task load and trial start; the only hard error is a sidecar entry whose source is not an absolute path. Overlap handling also changed: previously entries that shared a basename collided silently on the host (everything landed at `artifacts/<basename>`, last write winning). Now that each entry mirrors its full source path under one flat `artifacts/` base dir, equal or nested sources (or destinations) are detected — they emit a load-time warning, and at collection time the first claimant is kept while the rest are skipped (recorded in `manifest.json`).

### Other Changes

- `BaseEnvironment` gains per-service operations: `service_exec`, `service_download_file`, `service_download_dir`, `service_download_dir_with_exclusions`, `service_is_dir`, and `stop_service`. Compose-capable providers (docker, daytona, modal, islo, gke, novita, langsmith) implement them; others raise `ServiceOperationsUnsupportedError` for non-main services.
- A contract test (`tests/unit/environments/test_compose_contract.py`) statically enforces that any environment claiming the `docker_compose` capability also implements the per-service operations, so a future compose provider cannot ship sidecar-incapable and fail mid-trial.
- In separate verifier mode, the main service is stopped before sidecar evidence is collected, so leftover agent processes cannot interfere with collection.
- Sidecar `service_exec` (and collect hooks) wrap commands with POSIX `sh -c` instead of `bash -c`, so they run on minimal sidecar images (e.g. `*-alpine` variants) that ship only `sh`. The `main` container still uses `bash`. Authors needing bash on a sidecar can invoke it explicitly (`bash -c '...'`) on images that provide it.
- Verifier-bound artifact uploads now create parent directories in the verifier container; verifier images no longer need `RUN mkdir -p` for every declared artifact path.
- The collection manifest accumulates entries across per-service collection passes and is no longer uploaded into the verifier environment.
- New example task: `examples/tasks/sidecar-artifacts`.

## 2026-06-20 — Unified Agent, Environment, and Verifier Flags

`--agent`, `--env`, and `--verifier` each now accept a custom import path (`module.path:ClassName`) alongside their built-in values, so one flag selects either a built-in or a custom implementation. The legacy `--agent-import-path`, `--environment-import-path`, `--environment-type`, and `--verifier-import-path` flags still work but are hidden and log a deprecation warning when used. If both a deprecated flag and its replacement are passed, the unified flag wins.

---

## 2026-05-30 — Phase-Scoped Network Policy

Network policy is scoped to trial phases: `[environment]` (and `[verifier.environment]`) set baselines at env start; optional `[agent]` / `[verifier]` overrides apply only during `agent.run()` / `verify()`. Unsupported policies fail at trial init. Shared-verifier tasks with a verifier phase policy that differs from the agent baseline require `dynamic_network_policy` or `verifier.environment_mode = "separate"`. Run-time host merges use `--allow-environment-host` and `--allow-agent-host` (`environment.extra_allowed_hosts` / `agent.extra_allowed_hosts` on `TrialConfig`).

- New tasks default to schema version `1.3`. Schema `1.2` tasks still load.
- Legacy `[environment].allow_internet` is still accepted and mapped to `[environment].network_mode`.
- E2B supports runtime network switches via `update_network()`; allowlist enforcement also on ISLO (see provider docs).

---

## 2026-05-21 — Resource Enforcement Policies

Jobs and trials can set `cpu_enforcement_policy` and `memory_enforcement_policy` (`auto`, `limit`, `request`, `guarantee`, `ignore`) to control how task `cpus` / `memory_mb` are applied per provider. Harbor validates provider support at job start (env-only) and required task values at environment construction.

### Breaking Changes

#### Task `[environment]` resource defaults removed

`cpus`, `memory_mb`, `storage_mb`, and `gpus` in `task.toml` no longer default to `1`, `2048`, `10240`, and `0` when omitted. Omitted fields are `None` and Harbor applies provider defaults instead of injecting Harbor-side limits (e.g. Docker no longer gets 1 CPU / 2 GB unless the task or job config sets them). Numeric overrides at run time remain `--override-cpus` and `--override-memory-mb`.

#### Stricter resource enforcement validation

Jobs fail at `Job.create` when `cpu_enforcement_policy` or `memory_enforcement_policy` is incompatible with the selected environment type (e.g. `request` on Docker). Trials fail at environment construction when a non-`ignore` policy requires `cpus` or `memory_mb` but the task omits them.

### Other Changes

- `harbor run --cpus` and `--memory` set enforcement policies (`auto`, `limit`, `request`, `guarantee`, `ignore`); use `--override-cpus` and `--override-memory-mb` for numeric overrides.

- Split `EnvironmentCapabilities` (feature flags) from `EnvironmentResourceCapabilities` (CPU/memory limit vs request support); each provider declares the latter via `resource_capabilities()`.
- Docker, Modal, GKE, and cloud sandboxes advertise distinct resource enforcement behavior; unsupported policy/mode pairs fail before trials start.

---

## 2026-05-14 — Separate Verifier Environments

Tasks can now run verifiers in a dedicated environment with `[verifier].environment_mode = "separate"` and optional `[verifier.environment]`. Multi-step tasks can override verifier mode per step, including mixed shared/separate verification.

### Breaking Changes

#### `BaseEnvironment.env_paths` removed

Environment paths are no longer owned by environment instances. Use `EnvironmentPaths.for_os(env.os)` instead. `BaseEnvironment.task_os` remains as a deprecated alias for `BaseEnvironment.os`.

### Other Changes

- `[verifier.environment]` implies separate mode; `environment_mode = "shared"` with `[verifier.environment]` is invalid.
- Docker Compose runtime mounts now come from a generated `docker-compose-mounts.json` override. Legacy `HOST_VERIFIER_LOGS_PATH`, `HOST_AGENT_LOGS_PATH`, `HOST_ARTIFACTS_PATH`, and matching `ENV_*` variables remain available as deprecated compatibility aliases.
- Separate verifier environments receive `/logs/artifacts` plus configured task, trial, and step artifacts, but not agent logs unless explicitly listed as artifacts.
- Separate verifier images are built from `tests/` or `steps/<name>/tests/` and must provide `/tests/test.sh` or `/tests/test.bat` themselves.
- Task validation now checks test scripts against the effective verifier OS, including per-step verifier environments.
- `--mounts` replaces `--mounts-json`; the old flag and `EnvironmentConfig.mounts_json` remain as deprecated aliases.

---

## 2026-05-06 — Runtime, Upload, and Sandbox Fixes

### Breaking Changes

#### Terminus 2 and LiteLLM no longer send a default temperature

`terminus-2` no longer defaults `temperature` to `0.7`, and LiteLLM no longer defaults `temperature` to `1`. If no temperature is configured, Harbor omits the temperature parameter when constructing the LLM backend and omits `temperature` from Terminus 2 trajectory metadata. Set `temperature` explicitly to preserve previous sampling behavior.

### Other Changes

- Blaxel is now available as a cloud sandbox provider via `harbor[blaxel]` and `--env blaxel`.
- Large Hub uploads now stream from disk and use resumable Supabase uploads for large logs, archives, and packages.
- LangSmith sandboxes are now available as a cloud environment via `harbor[langsmith]` and `--env langsmith`.
- `opencode` now accepts arbitrary providers through `-m`, and `kimi-cli` supports OpenRouter.
- `cursor-cli` trajectory conversion now recognizes Cursor's `interaction_query` stream events and skips them without dropping the trajectory.
- `cursor-cli` now skips unsupported future Cursor stream event types at debug level instead of aborting trajectory conversion for the entire run.
- Tensorlake is now documented as a sandbox provider, and snapshot restores skip redundant baseline setup.
- Registry, Hub, and Supabase endpoints can now be overridden with environment variables for non-production deployments.

---

## 2026-04-29 — Job Result Progress Stats

Harbor now writes useful live progress information into each job's existing `result.json` during execution. The viewer uses this to show completed, running, pending, cancelled, errored, and retry counts for in-progress or interrupted jobs without introducing a separate event log.

### Breaking Changes

#### `JobResult.stats.n_trials` / `n_errors` renamed

Job-level `JobStats` now uses `n_completed_trials` and `n_errored_trials` instead of `n_trials` and `n_errors`. Existing `result.json` files still load through a compatibility migration, but code that reads `JobResult.stats` directly should use the new names.

Additional job-level progress fields are now available on `JobResult.stats`: `n_running_trials`, `n_pending_trials`, `n_cancelled_trials`, and `n_retries`.

---

## 2026-04-23 — Environment Capabilities & Windows-Aware Shell

Environments now expose their capabilities through a single `EnvironmentCapabilities` model instead of several individual properties. Shell commands produced by Harbor are OS-aware: Windows tasks get cmd.exe-appropriate quoting and execution, and environments that cannot run Windows containers fail fast at construction.

### Breaking Changes

#### 1. `BaseEnvironment.is_mounted` / `supports_gpus` / `can_disable_internet` removed from public API

These properties are gone on `BaseEnvironment`. Read from the new `capabilities` property instead:

```python
# Before
if env.is_mounted: ...
if env.supports_gpus: ...
if env.can_disable_internet: ...

# After
if env.capabilities.mounted: ...
if env.capabilities.gpus: ...
if env.capabilities.disable_internet: ...
```

The new `EnvironmentCapabilities` model also carries `windows: bool` (see below).

#### 2. Third-party `BaseEnvironment` subclasses

Subclasses should now override a single `capabilities` property:

```python
class MyEnv(BaseEnvironment):
    @property
    def capabilities(self) -> EnvironmentCapabilities:
        return EnvironmentCapabilities(disable_internet=True, mounted=True)
```

Subclasses still overriding the legacy `supports_gpus` / `can_disable_internet` / `is_mounted` properties continue to work via a compatibility shim and emit a `DeprecationWarning` at class definition. The shim will be removed in a future release.

#### 3. Windows environment support is now explicit

`BaseEnvironment` construction raises `RuntimeError` if the task declares `[environment].os = "windows"` and the environment's `capabilities.windows` is `False`. Built-in: only `DockerEnvironment` supports Windows today.

### Other Changes

- New `harbor.utils.scripts.quote_shell_arg(value, task_os)` dispatches to `shlex.quote` for POSIX and a cmd.exe-safe double-quote wrapper for Windows. `build_execution_command` now accepts a `task_os` keyword and quotes internally.
- `BaseEnvironment.is_dir` and `is_file` branch on the target OS — `test -d`/`test -f` on POSIX, cmd.exe's trailing-backslash `if exist` idiom on Windows.
- `Verifier` no longer pre-quotes container paths; it passes raw strings plus `task_os`.

---

## 2026-04-22 — Multi-Step Tasks

Tasks can now define a sequence of `[[steps]]` in `task.toml`. Each step has its own `instruction.md`, `tests/`, and optional `solution/` and `workdir/` under `steps/<name>/`, and runs against the same environment. Verification runs between steps and produces per-step rewards.

```toml
# task.toml
schema_version = "1.1"
multi_step_reward_strategy = "mean"  # "mean" (default) | "final"

[[steps]]
name = "scaffold"
min_reward = 1.0  # optional: abort remaining steps if this step's reward is below threshold

[steps.agent]
timeout_sec = 60.0

[[steps]]
name = "implement"
```

The trial-level reward is derived from per-step verifier results via `multi_step_reward_strategy`: `mean` averages per-key rewards across steps, `final` uses the last step's result verbatim. Per-step `min_reward` supports early stopping. The viewer renders per-step rewards and trajectories.

Single-step tasks are unaffected — omit `[[steps]]` and the original task layout continues to work.

See [docs/tasks/multi-step](https://harborframework.com/docs/tasks/multi-step) and `examples/tasks/hello-multi-step-simple` for a worked example.

---

## 2026-04-15 — Cloud Provider Dependencies Split Out

Cloud provider SDKs are now optional dependencies instead of being installed by default. Install only the providers you need:

```bash
pip install harbor[daytona]   # Daytona
pip install harbor[e2b]       # E2B
pip install harbor[modal]     # Modal
pip install harbor[runloop]   # Runloop
pip install harbor[langsmith] # LangSmith
pip install harbor[gke]       # Google Kubernetes Engine
pip install harbor[cloud]     # All cloud providers
```

If you previously relied on cloud provider packages being available after `pip install harbor`, you now need to install the relevant extras explicitly.

---

## 2026-04-14 — Download Export/Cache Modes

### Breaking Changes

#### `BaseRegistryClient.download_dataset()` and `TaskClient.download_tasks()` — new `export` parameter

Both methods now accept an `export: bool = False` parameter that controls the download path layout. Subclasses that override `download_dataset()` must add this parameter to their signature:

```python
# Before
async def download_dataset(self, name, overwrite=False, output_dir=None, ...) -> list[DownloadedDatasetItem]:

# After
async def download_dataset(self, name, overwrite=False, output_dir=None, export=False, ...) -> list[DownloadedDatasetItem]:
```

When `export=False` (default), behavior is unchanged — tasks download to the cache with content-addressable paths (`<org>/<name>/<digest>/`). When `export=True`, tasks download to a flat layout (`<task-name>/`).

---

## 2026-03-27 — Package Registry

### Breaking Changes

#### 1. `Trial` and `Job` constructors are now async factory methods

Direct instantiation via `Trial(config)` and `Job(config)` now raises `ValueError`. Use the async factory methods instead:

```python
# Before
trial = Trial(config)
job = Job(config)

# After
trial = await Trial.create(config)
job = await Job.create(config)
```

This change was necessary because task downloading (`TaskClient.download_tasks`) and dataset resolution (`DatasetConfig.get_task_configs`) are now async operations.

#### 2. `LocalDatasetConfig` + `RegistryDatasetConfig` replaced by flat `DatasetConfig`

The `BaseDatasetConfig` ABC and its two subclasses (`LocalDatasetConfig`, `RegistryDatasetConfig`) have been replaced by a single flat `DatasetConfig` model. The nested `registry: LocalRegistryInfo | RemoteRegistryInfo` field is replaced by top-level `registry_url` and `registry_path` fields. A new `ref` field supports package-based datasets.

```python
# Before
from harbor.models.job.config import LocalDatasetConfig, RegistryDatasetConfig
from harbor.models.registry import RemoteRegistryInfo

local = LocalDatasetConfig(path=Path("./tasks"))
remote = RegistryDatasetConfig(
    name="terminal-bench",
    version="2.0",
    registry=RemoteRegistryInfo(url="https://..."),
)

# After
from harbor.models.job.config import DatasetConfig

local = DatasetConfig(path=Path("./tasks"))
registry = DatasetConfig(name="terminal-bench", version="2.0", registry_url="https://...")
package = DatasetConfig(name="harbor/terminal-bench", ref="latest")
```

A migration validator handles the old nested `registry` key with a deprecation warning. `LocalDatasetConfig` and `RegistryDatasetConfig` are still importable as aliases but both resolve to `DatasetConfig`.

`DatasetConfig.get_task_configs()` is now **async**.

#### 3. `RegistryClientFactory.create()` signature changed

```python
# Before
from harbor.models.registry import LocalRegistryInfo, RemoteRegistryInfo
client = RegistryClientFactory.create(RemoteRegistryInfo(url="https://..."))

# After
client = RegistryClientFactory.create(registry_url="https://...")
```

#### 4. `BaseRegistryClient` API changes

| `_get_dataset_spec(name, version)` (abstract) | `async _get_dataset_metadata(name)` (abstract, returns `DatasetMetadata`)                  |
| `download_dataset(...)`                       | `async download_dataset(...)`                                                              |


#### 5. `TaskClient.download_tasks()` is now async with changed return type

```python
# Before (sync, returns list[Path])
paths = client.download_tasks(task_ids=[...])

# After (async, returns BatchDownloadResult)
result = await client.download_tasks(task_ids=[...])
paths = result.paths
```

Also accepts the new `PackageTaskId` type in `task_ids`.

#### 6. `TaskConfig` (trial config) — `path` is now optional

`TaskConfig.path` changed from `Path` (required) to `Path | None = None`. New fields `name: str | None` and `ref: str | None` support package-based tasks. A model validator enforces that exactly one of `path` or `name` is set.

## 2026-03-24 — Configurable Agent User & Agent Architecture Rework

### Breaking Changes

#### 1. `BaseInstalledAgent` API overhaul

The agent base class has been significantly reworked. If you have a custom agent that extends `BaseInstalledAgent`, the following methods and properties have been **removed**:


| Removed                                   | Replacement                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `_install_agent_template_path` (property) | `install(environment)` (async method)                                        |
| `create_run_agent_commands(instruction)`  | `run(instruction, environment, context)` (async method — implement directly) |
| `create_cleanup_commands()`               | Handle cleanup inline in your `run()` method                                 |
| `_template_variables` (property)          | No longer needed — install logic is now inline Python                        |
| `_setup_env()`                            | Pass `env=` directly to `exec_as_root()` / `exec_as_agent()`                 |
| `ExecInput` (dataclass)                   | Use `exec_as_root()` / `exec_as_agent()` helpers directly                    |


**How to migrate a custom agent:**

Before (old pattern):

```python
class MyAgent(BaseInstalledAgent):
    @property
    def _install_agent_template_path(self) -> Path:
        return Path(__file__).parent / "install-my-agent.sh.j2"

    def create_run_agent_commands(self, instruction: str) -> list[ExecInput]:
        return [
            ExecInput(command="my-agent setup", env={"FOO": "bar"}),
            ExecInput(command=f"my-agent run {shlex.quote(instruction)}"),
        ]

    def populate_context_post_run(self, context: AgentContext) -> None:
        # parse trajectory...
```

After (new pattern):

```python
class MyAgent(BaseInstalledAgent):
    async def install(self, environment: BaseEnvironment) -> None:
        await self.exec_as_root(environment, command="apt-get install -y curl")
        await self.exec_as_agent(environment, command="pip install my-agent")

    @with_prompt_template
    async def run(self, instruction: str, environment: BaseEnvironment, context: AgentContext) -> None:
        await self.exec_as_agent(environment, command="my-agent setup", env={"FOO": "bar"})
        await self.exec_as_agent(environment, command=f"my-agent run {shlex.quote(instruction)}")

    def populate_context_post_run(self, context: AgentContext) -> None:
        # parse trajectory...
```

Key differences:

- `**install()**` replaces the Jinja2 shell template. Write install logic as direct `exec_as_root` / `exec_as_agent` calls instead of a `.sh.j2` template.
- `**run()**` is now an abstract method you implement directly. Use the `@with_prompt_template` decorator to automatically apply prompt template rendering to the instruction.
- `**exec_as_root(environment, command, ...)**` — runs a command as `root` (for system packages, symlinks, etc.).
- `**exec_as_agent(environment, command, ...)**` — runs a command as the task's configured agent user (falls back to the environment's default user).
- Both helpers handle logging, `_extra_env` merging, `set -o pipefail`, and error handling automatically.
- The base class `run()` method (which looped over `ExecInput` objects) has been removed — you now own the full execution flow.

#### 2. Jinja2 install templates removed

All `install-*.sh.j2` files have been deleted. If you referenced these templates or had tooling that generated/modified them, switch to the `install()` method pattern described above.

Removed files:

- `src/harbor/agents/installed/install-claude-code.sh.j2`
- `src/harbor/agents/installed/install-aider.sh.j2`
- `src/harbor/agents/installed/install-codex.sh.j2`
- `src/harbor/agents/installed/install-cursor-cli.sh.j2`
- `src/harbor/agents/installed/install-gemini-cli.sh.j2`
- `src/harbor/agents/installed/install-goose.sh.j2`
- `src/harbor/agents/installed/install-hermes.sh.j2`
- `src/harbor/agents/installed/install-kimi-cli.sh.j2`
- `src/harbor/agents/installed/install-mini-swe-agent.sh.j2`
- `src/harbor/agents/installed/install-opencode.sh.j2`
- `src/harbor/agents/installed/install-openhands.sh.j2`
- `src/harbor/agents/installed/install-qwen-code.sh.j2`
- `src/harbor/agents/installed/install-swe-agent.sh.j2`
- `src/harbor/agents/installed/cline/install-cline.sh.j2`

#### 3. `BaseEnvironment.exec()` now accepts a `user` parameter

The `exec()` method on all environment implementations now accepts an optional `user` keyword argument:

```python
await environment.exec(command="whoami", user="agent")  # run as specific user
await environment.exec(command="whoami")                  # uses environment.default_user
```

If you have a custom environment provider that overrides `exec()`, you must add the `user: str | int | None = None` parameter to your signature and handle it appropriately.

The `is_dir()` and `is_file()` methods also now accept an optional `user` parameter.

#### 4. `BaseEnvironment.default_user` attribute

All environments now have a `default_user: str | int | None` attribute (initialized to `None`). The trial orchestrator sets this before calling `agent.setup()` and `agent.run()`, and resets it for verification. If `exec()` is called without an explicit `user`, it falls back to `default_user`.

Custom environment implementations should call `self._resolve_user(user)` in their `exec()` method to respect this fallback.

### New Features

#### Configurable agent and verifier user in `task.toml`

Tasks can now specify which user the agent and verifier run as:

```toml
[agent]
timeout_sec = 120.0
user = "agent"        # NEW: run the agent as this OS user

[verifier]
timeout_sec = 120.0
user = "root"         # NEW: run the verifier as this OS user
```

When `agent.user` is set, the environment's `default_user` is configured accordingly before `setup()` and `run()` are called. This means agents don't need to be aware of user switching — `exec_as_agent()` and bare `environment.exec()` calls automatically run as the configured user.

If not specified, behavior is unchanged (uses the environment/container's default user, typically `root`).

#### `with_prompt_template` decorator

A new decorator for agent `run()` methods that automatically renders the instruction through the configured prompt template:

```python
from harbor.agents.installed.base import with_prompt_template

@with_prompt_template
async def run(self, instruction, environment, context):
    # instruction is already rendered
    ...
```

This replaces the manual `render_prompt_template()` call that was previously handled by the base class.

#### `hello-user` example task

A new example task at `examples/tasks/hello-user/` demonstrates the configurable user feature. It creates an `agent` user in the Dockerfile and sets `agent.user = "agent"` in `task.toml`.
