## **I. Introduction**

The **Agent Trajectory Interchange Format (ATIF)** is a standardized, JSON-based specification for logging the complete interaction history of autonomous LLM agents. ATIF is designed to unify the distinct data requirements of conversational logs, explicit action sequences (MiniSweAgent[^1]), and replayable data structures (OpenHands), ensuring collected data is immediately usable across debugging, visualization, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) pipelines.

This format will serve as the standardized data logging methodology for the Harbor project.

### **Trajectory Definition**

For the purpose of ATIF, a trajectory is defined as a sequence of interactions between a user and an agent, including the agent's internal reasoning, actions, and observations. The trajectory captures the complete interaction history, including all user messages (initial and subsequent), agent responses, tool executions, and environment feedback. This design supports both single-turn tasks and multi-turn conversational interactions.

### **Version History**

**v1.7 (Current)**

- Added `extra` field to `ToolCallSchema` for custom tool-call metadata
- Added `extra` field to `ObservationResultSchema` for custom observation metadata
- Added `subagent_trajectories` field to root `Trajectory` for single-file subagent embedding
- Added `trajectory_id` field to `Trajectory` as the per-document identifier for embedded-subagent resolution (avoids overloading `session_id` with document-level uniqueness). `trajectory_id` is REQUIRED on embedded subagents and MUST be unique within a parent's `subagent_trajectories` array.
- Relaxed `Trajectory.session_id` from Required to Optional and clarified its semantics: `session_id` is run-scoped (not document-scoped), MAY be shared across sibling subagents, continuation trajectories, or omitted on embedded subagents that inherit the parent's run identity. `session_id` is no longer overloaded as the canonical matching key for subagent references.
- Added `trajectory_id` field to `SubagentTrajectoryRef` as the canonical resolution key for embedded references. Made `session_id` optional on the ref and reclassified it as **informational only** — `session_id` is run-scoped and is NOT a valid resolution key (two sibling subagents MAY legitimately share a `session_id`). A ref MUST set at least one of `trajectory_id` (embedded form) or `trajectory_path` (file-ref form) so it is resolvable; `session_id` alone is insufficient. **Breaking vs. v1.6**: in v1.6 `session_id` was required on `SubagentTrajectoryRef` and served as the resolution key, so a ref of the shape `{"session_id": "..."}` (no `trajectory_path`) was valid; under v1.7 such a ref no longer validates. Producers MUST migrate by setting `trajectory_id` (and a corresponding `trajectory_id` on the embedded subagent in `subagent_trajectories`) for embedded refs, or `trajectory_path` for external-file refs.
- Added `llm_call_count` field to `StepObject` for multi-LLM-call step representation
- Added `context_management` convention for system steps that transform the agent's context window (see Section VII)
- Resolved no-LLM orchestration by defining `llm_call_count = 0` semantics on `source: "agent"` steps to signal deterministic dispatch
- Note: contributed by Bryan Bednarski and Anuradha Karuppiah from NVIDIA

**v1.6**

- Added multimodal content support for images in trajectories
- Added `ContentPartSchema` for representing mixed text/image content
- Added `ImageSourceSchema` for referencing image files stored alongside trajectories
- Extended `message` field in `StepObject` to accept either a string or array of `ContentPart` objects
- Extended `content` field in `ObservationResultSchema` to accept either a string or array of `ContentPart` objects
- Images are stored as separate files (e.g., in an `images/` subdirectory) and referenced by relative path
- Added `has_multimodal_content()` method to Trajectory model for checking if trajectory contains images

**v1.5**

- Added optional `tool_definitions` field to `AgentSchema` for storing tool/function definitions
- Enables proper tool call definitions for SFT training pipelines

**v1.4**

- Added optional `prompt_token_ids` field to `MetricsSchema` for storing prompt token IDs
- `prompt_token_ids` contains the actual tokens sent to the LLM in that turn, including previous chat history if applicable

**v1.3**

- Added optional `completion_token_ids` field to `MetricsSchema` for storing completion token IDs
- Token IDs enable accurate reinforcement learning training by avoiding retokenization drift

**v1.2**

- Extended `observation` field to support system steps for tracking system-initiated operations
- System steps can now include observations for events such as subagent delegation, context management, environment resets, or checkpoint creation
- Clarified that `prompt_tokens` includes ALL input tokens (both cached and non-cached), with `cached_tokens` tracking the subset that were cache hits

**v1.1**

- Added optional `extra` field at root level for custom metadata not covered by the core schema

**v1.0**

- Initial specification release

## **II. Schema**

### **Root-Level Metadata**

The root object stores global context and a flexible field for custom information:

| Field                      | Type    | Status   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :------------------------- | :------ | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| schema_version             | String  | Required | String defining ATIF compatibility (e.g., "ATIF-v1.7").                                                                                                                                                                               |
| session_id                 | String  | Optional | Identifier for the agent run this trajectory belongs to. **Run-scoped, not document-scoped**: multiple Trajectory objects MAY share the same `session_id` when they represent the same logical run (e.g., a parent trajectory and its embedded subagents, or a trajectory and its continuation segments linked via `continued_trajectory_ref`). `session_id`s within a parent's `subagent_trajectories` array are therefore NOT required to be unique. Use `trajectory_id` when a per-trajectory-document unique identifier is required. Required in v1.6 and earlier; relaxed to Optional in v1.7. Producers SHOULD set this on root trajectories for run-level traceability, and MAY omit it on embedded subagents that inherit the parent's run identity. |
| trajectory_id              | String  | Optional | Canonical per-trajectory-document identifier, distinct from `session_id`. Unlike `session_id` (which is run-scoped and MAY be shared), `trajectory_id` uniquely identifies THIS trajectory object. Used to resolve `SubagentTrajectoryRef` entries against the root's `subagent_trajectories` array without overloading `session_id`'s run-scoped semantics. Optional on standalone trajectories, but REQUIRED on any trajectory embedded in a parent's `subagent_trajectories` array. `trajectory_id`s within a single parent's `subagent_trajectories` array MUST be unique. Added in ATIF-v1.7. |
| agent                      | Object  | Required | Object specifying the agent configuration (name, version, and optional custom fields). See _AgentSchema_ below.                                                                                                                       |
| steps                      | Array   | Required | Array of step objects representing the complete interaction history, including user messages, agent responses, tool calls, and observations.                                                                                          |
| notes                      | String  | Optional | A string field for developers to include custom information, design notes, or explanations for format discrepancies.                                                                                                                  |
| final_metrics              | Object  | Optional | Summary metrics for the entire trajectory. See _FinalMetricsSchema_ below.                                                                                                                                                            |
| continued_trajectory_ref   | String  | Optional | Reference to the continuation trajectory file if this trajectory is continued in another file. Enables agents to link trajectory segments when context management strategies (e.g., summarization) produce multiple trajectory files. |
| extra                      | Object  | Optional | Object for custom root-level metadata not covered by the core schema.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| subagent_trajectories      | Array   | Optional | Array of embedded subagent trajectories. Each element is a complete, independently-valid ATIF `Trajectory` object with its own `schema_version`, `trajectory_id`, `agent`, and `step_id` sequence starting at 1 — the same schema and validation rules as the parent trajectory. Enables single-file storage of multi-agent workflows: when a `SubagentTrajectoryRef.trajectory_path` is null, consumers resolve the reference by matching `SubagentTrajectoryRef.trajectory_id` against `Trajectory.trajectory_id` of entries in this array. **Uniqueness rules**: every embedded subagent MUST set `trajectory_id`, and `trajectory_id`s within this array MUST be unique. `session_id`, by contrast, is run-scoped and MAY collide across siblings (or match the parent's `session_id`) when all trajectories belong to the same logical run; embedded subagents MAY also omit `session_id` entirely to inherit the parent's run identity. When `trajectory_path` is set, the reference points at an external file instead; embedded and file-ref forms MAY be mixed within the same parent trajectory. |

### **AgentSchema**

The required _agent_ object identifies the agent system used for the trajectory. The `name` and `version` fields are required, while `model_name`, `tool_definitions`, and `extra` are optional.

| Field            | Type   | Status   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| version          | String | Required | The version identifier of the agent system (e.g., "1.0.0", "v2.3.1").                                                                                                                        |
| model_name       | String | Optional | Default LLM model used for this trajectory (e.g., "gemini-2.5-flash", "claude-3-5-sonnet"). Step-level model_name overrides this if specified.                                               |
| tool_definitions | Array  | Optional | Array of tool/function definitions available to the agent. Each element follows OpenAI's function calling schema with `type` and `function` fields containing the tool's signature and docs. |
| extra            | Object | Optional | Object for custom agent configuration details not covered by the core schema (e.g., prompting strategy, custom parameters).                                                                  |

| total_steps             | Integer | Optional | Total number of steps (can be unequal to length of steps array if explained in notes). |
| extra                   | Object  | Optional | Object for custom aggregate metrics not covered by the core schema.                    |

### **StepObject**

The _steps_ array contains all interaction turns. Each _StepObject_ represents either a system prompt, a user message, or a complete agent turn (LLM inference, action execution, and observation receipt).

| Field             | Type                      | Status   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| source            | String                    | Required | The originator of this step. Must be one of: "system" (for system prompts), "user" (for user messages), or "agent" (for agent responses).                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| model_name        | String                    | Optional | The specific LLM model used for this turn (e.g., gemini-2.5-flash). Only applicable when source is "agent". If omitted, the model can be inferred from the top-level agent configuration.                                                                                                                                                                         |

For multimodal content (v1.6+), this can be an array of `ContentPart` objects. For system steps, this is the system prompt. For user steps, this is the user's prompt or instruction. For agent steps, this is the assistant's response. This field is required but can be an empty string.        |
| reasoning_content | String                    | Optional | String field detailing the agent's explicit internal reasoning. Only applicable when source is "agent".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| tool_calls        | Array                     | Optional | An array of structured objects for the agent's action(s). A single LLM output may contain multiple tool calls. Only applicable when source is "agent". See _ToolCallSchema_ below.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| observation       | Object                    | Optional | Environment feedback/result after actions or system events. For agent steps, this contains results from tool calls, non-tool actions, or subagent delegation. For system steps, this may contain results from system-initiated operations (e.g., subagent delegation, context management, environment reset, checkpoint creation). See _ObservationSchema_ below. |
| metrics           | Object                    | Optional | Object containing all LLM operational and confidence data for this step, including RL-specific fields (reward, log\*probs) if applicable. Only applicable when source is "agent". See _MetricsSchema_ below.                                                                                                                                                      |
| extra             | Object                    | Optional | Object for custom step-level metadata not covered by the core schema. Applicable to all step types (system, user, and agent).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| llm_call_count    | Integer                   | Optional | Number of LLM inferences this step represents. When `llm_call_count > 1`, the `metrics` are aggregated across multiple LLM calls and per-call attribution is unavailable. When `1`, the step represents exactly one inference. When `0` on a `source: "agent"` step, the step represents a deterministic (non-LLM) dispatch — a graph engine, rule-based pipeline, or eval harness that issued `tool_calls` without an LLM inference; `metrics` and `reasoning_content` MUST be absent on such steps, and SFT pipelines MUST filter them out. When null, the producer did not track this (backward-compatible default). Applicable to all step types. |
| is_copied_context | Boolean                   | Optional | Indicates this step was copied from a prior trajectory into the current trajectory for context purposes (e.g., steps retained across a summarization/compression boundary). When `True`, producers assert the step is not a new interaction and consumers MUST filter it out of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) training data. Absent or `None` means the step is a new interaction produced in the current trajectory scope. See normative usage below. Applicable to all step types. |

**Normative usage of `is_copied_context`:** Producers MUST set `is_copied_context = True` on all steps that are copied from a prior trajectory into the current trajectory for context purposes. This includes steps inserted during context compression events (e.g., after a summarization pass that replaces older steps with a compressed summary, the retained "prior context" steps that are copied into the new trajectory scope). Steps with `is_copied_context = True` MUST NOT be included in supervised fine-tuning (SFT) training data, as they represent previously-trained interactions whose contribution to the agent's behavior has already been captured. Consumers reading ATIF trajectories for SFT purposes MUST filter out steps where `is_copied_context = True` before constructing training examples. If `is_copied_context` is absent or `None`, the step is assumed to be a new interaction produced in the current trajectory scope.

**One-LLM-per-step convention:** Exporters SHOULD emit one ATIF step per LLM inference when the underlying framework provides per-call event boundaries (e.g., `LLM_START`/`LLM_END`). When an exporter cannot split calls (e.g., an opaque tool with multiple internal LLM calls), it MUST set `llm_call_count` to the actual count so consumers can detect aggregated metrics.

### **ToolCallSchema**

The optional _tool_calls_ array contains structured objects representing function or tool invocations made by the agent. Each element follows this schema:

| Field         | Type   | Status   | Description                                                                                                                          |

| function_name | String | Required | The name of the function or tool being invoked (e.g., "financial_search", "file_write", "web_search").                               |
| arguments     | Object | Required | Object containing the arguments passed to the function. Must be a valid JSON object, but can be empty (`{}`) if no arguments needed. |
| extra         | Object                    | Optional | Object for custom tool-call-level metadata not covered by the core schema (e.g., timeout, retry count, tool version).  

### **MetricsSchema**

All fields within the optional _metrics_ object are optional.

| Field                | Type    | Status   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| :------------------- | :------ | :------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| prompt_tokens        | Integer | Optional | Total input tokens sent to the model for this turn, including both cached and non-cached tokens. This represents the full size of the prompt (system prompt, history, tool definitions, etc.) that was processed by the model, regardless of whether some tokens were served from cache. |
| completion_tokens    | Integer | Optional | Total tokens generated by the LLM response (including reasoning and tool calls).                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| cached_tokens        | Integer | Optional | Subset of `prompt_tokens` that were cache hits from prompt caching (e.g., a prefix or history cache). This counts tokens that were reused from cache rather than reprocessed. **This is included in the `prompt_tokens` count**, not separate from it.                                   |
| cost_usd             | Float   | Optional | Monetary cost of the API call based on current provider pricing for this step.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| prompt_token_ids     | Array   | Optional | Array of integer token IDs for the prompt (input) tokens sent to the LLM in this step, including previous chat history if applicable. Enables accurate analysis and debugging of prompt tokenization. Length should match `prompt_tokens` count.                                         |
| completion_token_ids | Array   | Optional | Array of integer token IDs for the completion (response) tokens generated in this step. Enables accurate RL training by avoiding retokenization drift. Should align with `logprobs` array if both are present. Length should match `completion_tokens` count.                            |
| logprobs             | Array   | Optional | Array of log probabilities for each completion token.[^7] Should align with `completion_token_ids` array if both are present. Length should match `completion_tokens` count.                                                                                                             |
| extra                | Object  | Optional | Object for provider-specific or experimental metrics not covered by the core schema (e.g., reasoning_tokens, cache_creation_input_tokens).                                                                                                                                               |

**Token Accounting and Cost Calculation:**

ATIF defines `prompt_tokens` as the total count of all input tokens (both cached and non-cached), with `cached_tokens` tracking the subset that were cache hits. This provides a complete view of prompt size while also tracking cache efficiency.

To calculate the total cost for a step:

```
non_cached_prompt_tokens = prompt_tokens - cached_tokens
cost_usd = (non_cached_prompt_tokens × cost_per_input_token) +
           (cached_tokens × cost_per_cached_token) +
           (completion_tokens × cost_per_completion_token)
```

Similarly, for trajectory-level costs in `final_metrics`:

```
non_cached_total = total_prompt_tokens - total_cached_tokens
total_cost_usd = (non_cached_total × cost_per_input_token) +
                 (total_cached_tokens × cost_per_cached_token) +
                 (total_completion_tokens × cost_per_completion_token)
```

Where:

- `total_prompt_tokens` = sum of all `prompt_tokens` across steps (includes all input tokens, both cached and non-cached)
- `total_cached_tokens` = sum of all `cached_tokens` across steps (subset of total_prompt_tokens)
- `total_completion_tokens` = sum of all `completion_tokens` across steps

Note that ATIF does not record per-token pricing information because:

1. Pricing can change over time, making historical trajectories inaccurate
2. Most agent frameworks don't record pricing, requiring a lookup table for conversion
3. Pricing varies by provider, tier, and region

The `cost_usd` and `total_cost_usd` fields store the calculated cost at the time of execution, providing a snapshot without coupling the format to specific pricing models.

**Important Note on Additional Cost Factors:**

Some LLM providers charge for additional factors beyond the standard token types. For example, Anthropic charges separately for `cache_creation_input_tokens` when new prompt cache entries are created. These additional cost factors should be recorded in the `extra` field within the `metrics` object.

When such additional cost factors exist, the simplified cost formula above may not accurately represent the actual cost. In these cases:

1. Record the **actual cost** in the `cost_usd` field if available from the provider
2. Store additional token metrics (e.g., `cache_creation_input_tokens`) in `metrics.extra`
3. The presence of values in `metrics.extra` signals that the standard formula may be incomplete

This approach ensures that actual costs are preserved accurately while maintaining the flexibility to accommodate provider-specific pricing models.

### **ObservationSchema**

The _observation_ object records results from the environment or system events. For agent steps, results may stem from structured _tool_calls_, agent actions that don't use standard tool calling mechanisms, or subagent delegation. For system steps, observations may contain results from system-initiated operations such as subagent delegation, context management, environment resets, checkpoint creation, or other infrastructure-level events.

| Field   | Type  | Status   | Description                                                                          |
| :------ | :---- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| results | Array | Required | Array of result objects, each containing feedback from a single tool call or action. |

#### **ObservationResultSchema**

Each element in the _results_ array follows this schema:

| Field                   | Type             | Status   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :---------------------- | :--------------- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| source_call_id          | String           | Optional | The `tool_call_id` from the _tool_calls_ array in _StepObject_ that this result corresponds to. If null or omitted, the result comes from an action that doesn't use the standard tool calling format (e.g., agent actions without tool calls or system-initiated operations). |
| content                 | String \| Array  | Optional | The output or result from the tool execution or action. For text-only content, this is a string. For multimodal content (v1.6+), this can be an array of `ContentPart` objects. May be omitted when `subagent_trajectory_ref` is present.                                      |
| subagent_trajectory_ref | Array            | Optional | Array of references to delegated subagent trajectories. Each element follows _SubagentTrajectoryRefSchema_. Use a singleton array for a single subagent.                                                                                                                       |
| extra                   | Object           | Optional | Object for custom observation-result-level metadata not covered by the core schema (e.g., confidence score, retrieval score, source document ID).   

Example:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "source_call_id": "call_price_1",
      "content": "GOOGL is currently trading at $185.35"
    }
  ]
}
```

Example (observation result with custom metadata):

```json
{
  "source_call_id": "call_search_001",
  "content": "NVIDIA announces new GPU architecture...",
  "extra": {
    "retrieval_score": 0.92,
    "source_doc_id": "doc-4821"
  }
}
```

### **ContentPartSchema (v1.6+)**

For multimodal content, the `message` field in _StepObject_ and the `content` field in _ObservationResultSchema_ can contain an array of `ContentPart` objects instead of a plain string. Each `ContentPart` represents either text or an image.

| Field  | Type   | Status      | Description                                                                                      |
| :----- | :----- | :---------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| type   | String | Required    | The type of content. Must be one of: "text" or "image".                                          |
| text   | String | Conditional | The text content. Required when `type` is "text", must be omitted when `type` is "image".        |
| source | Object | Conditional | The image source specification. Required when `type` is "image", must be omitted when `type` is "text". See _ImageSourceSchema_ below. |

Example (multimodal message with text and image):

```json
{
  "message": [
    { "type": "text", "text": "What is in this image?" },
    { "type": "image", "source": { "media_type": "image/png", "path": "images/step_1_input.png" } }
  ]
}
```

### **ImageSourceSchema (v1.6+)**

Images are stored as separate files alongside the trajectory JSON file and referenced by path or URL. This avoids bloating the trajectory file with base64-encoded image data.

| Field      | Type   | Status   | Description                                                                                                                                     |
| :--------- | :----- | :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| media_type | String | Required | MIME type of the image. Must be one of: "image/jpeg", "image/png", "image/gif", or "image/webp".                                                 |
| path       | String | Required | Location of the image. Can be a relative or absolute file path, or a URL.                                                                        |

**Image Storage Convention:**

For local storage, images are typically stored in an `images/` subdirectory relative to the trajectory file. For example, if the trajectory is at `agent/trajectory.json`, images would be stored at `agent/images/` with relative paths like `"images/screenshot.png"`.

Absolute file paths and URLs are also supported.

#### **SubagentTrajectoryRefSchema**

For multi-agent systems or hierarchical agent architectures, an observation result may reference a complete subagent trajectory. This enables tracking of recursive or delegated agent workflows where a parent agent spawns subagents to handle specific subtasks.

| Field           | Type   | Status      | Description                                                                                                |
| :-------------- | :----- | :---------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| trajectory_id   | String | Conditional | Canonical identifier of the delegated subagent trajectory, used to resolve **embedded** references. Matches `Trajectory.trajectory_id` of an entry in the parent's `subagent_trajectories` array. Added in ATIF-v1.7. At least one of `trajectory_id` or `trajectory_path` MUST be set so the ref is resolvable. |
| trajectory_path | String | Conditional | Location of the complete subagent trajectory as an external file (file path, S3 URL, database reference, etc.), used to resolve **file-ref** references. At least one of `trajectory_id` or `trajectory_path` MUST be set so the ref is resolvable. |
| session_id      | String | Optional    | Run identity of the delegated subagent trajectory. **Informational only** — recorded so consumers can correlate this ref back to the subagent's run for debug / search / display purposes. Run-scoped (see `Trajectory.session_id`) and therefore NOT a valid resolution key; consumers MUST NOT use `session_id` alone to resolve a ref. |
| extra           | Object | Optional    | Object for custom metadata about the subagent execution (e.g., summary, exit status, performance metrics). |

**Resolution mechanisms.** A `SubagentTrajectoryRef` has exactly two resolution mechanisms:

1. **Embedded form** — `trajectory_id` matches the `Trajectory.trajectory_id` of an entry in the parent's `subagent_trajectories` array.
2. **File-ref form** — `trajectory_path` points at an external trajectory file.

A ref MUST set at least one of these two fields. When both are set, consumers MAY choose either; typically `trajectory_id` is preferred when the embedded trajectory is available in-memory, and `trajectory_path` is used to stream or lazily load.

**Why `session_id` is not a resolution mechanism.** `session_id` is intentionally run-scoped (multiple Trajectory documents MAY share a `session_id` if they belong to the same logical run — parent + subagents, parent + continuations). Two sibling subagents that belong to the same run MAY legitimately share a `session_id`, so `session_id` cannot unambiguously identify *which* embedded trajectory a ref points at. `trajectory_id` was introduced in v1.7 to carry the document-level uniqueness guarantee that ref resolution requires, without overloading `session_id`'s run-scoped semantics. `session_id` on a ref is therefore purely informational — a human- and tooling-friendly breadcrumb back to the subagent's run — not a matching key.

**Pre-v1.7 back-compat.** Pre-v1.7 had only one resolution mechanism: `trajectory_path` (external file reference). The `subagent_trajectories` array on the root `Trajectory` and the embedded form via `trajectory_id` are both new in v1.7. Every pre-v1.7 ref that is actually resolvable therefore sets `trajectory_path`, which satisfies v1.7's at-least-one-of-(`trajectory_id`, `trajectory_path`) requirement — such refs remain valid, and their `session_id` (which in pre-v1.7 was required on the ref) is simply retained as informational metadata.

When _subagent_trajectory_ref_ is present, the `content` field may be omitted, as the complete trajectory provides full detail. Alternatively, `content` may contain a simplified summary for quick reference without loading the full subagent trajectory.

## **III. Agent Trajectory Format Comparative Schema**

This table summarizes how ATIF unifies the core requirements of existing agent platforms.

## **IV. Example ATIF Trajectory Log (Multi-Step Task)**

The following example illustrates a three-step task flow, where the user asks a question (step 1), the agent executes a search involving multiple tool calls (step 2), and then delivers a final conversational response (step 3).

**Task:** The user asks the agent to find the current price of a specific stock.

## **V. Real-World Trajectory Examples**

To illustrate the differences between existing agent trajectory formats and to provide concrete reference implementations, three example trajectories from different agent frameworks are available in the [`0001-trajectory-format/`](./0001-trajectory-format/) directory. All three trajectories execute the same simple task: _"Create a file called hello.txt with 'Hello, world!' as the content."_

### **Available Examples**

1. **[`mini-swe-agent-trajectory.json`](./0001-trajectory-format/mini-swe-agent-trajectory.json)** — MiniSweAgent format

   - Demonstrates explicit `THOUGHT` sections and bash command execution
   - Shows the conversational pattern where environment feedback is delivered as user messages
   - Includes detailed token usage and caching information from Claude 3.5 Sonnet
   - 3-step trajectory: create file → verify content → complete task

2. **[`openhands_trajectory.json`](./0001-trajectory-format/openhands_trajectory.json)** — OpenHands format

   - Structured as an event log with distinct action types (`system`, `message`, `run`, `finish`)
   - Includes extensive tool definitions and security risk assessments
   - Shows GPT-5 reasoning tokens (960 reasoning tokens in the response)
   - Demonstrates the `task_tracker` concept and rich observability metadata

3. **[`gemini-cli-trajectory.json`](./0001-trajectory-format/gemini-cli-trajectory.json)** — Gemini CLI format
   - Minimalist session-based format with message array
   - Includes embedded token metrics (input, output, cached, thoughts)
   - Single-step completion with Gemini 2.0 Flash
   - No explicit tool calls or structured actions

### **Key Insights from Examples**

These real-world trajectories highlight the diversity of current approaches:

- **Reasoning representation**: MiniSweAgent uses explicit `THOUGHT` fields, OpenHands embeds reasoning in tool calls, Gemini CLI tracks it in token metrics
- **Action logging**: Varies from bash strings (MiniSweAgent) to structured function calls (OpenHands) to implicit actions (Gemini CLI)
- **Observability**: OpenHands provides the richest metadata with tool call IDs and security assessments, while Gemini CLI is most minimal
- **Step granularity**: MiniSweAgent creates multiple steps for verification, while Gemini CLI completes the task in one step

ATIF aims to provide a unified format that can accommodate all these patterns while maintaining interoperability.

## **VI. Implementation**

### **Reference Implementation**

The Harbor project provides a reference implementation of ATIF in Python using Pydantic models for validation and type safety.

#### **Pydantic Models**

The complete ATIF schema is implemented as Pydantic models in the `src/harbor/models/trajectories/` directory:

- **`agent.py`** — Agent configuration model
- **`content.py`** — Multimodal content models (`ContentPart`, `ImageSource`) for v1.6+
- **`final_metrics.py`** — Aggregate trajectory metrics model
- **`metrics.py`** — Per-step LLM metrics model
- **`observation.py`** — Observation container model
- **`observation_result.py`** — Individual observation result model
- **`step.py`** — Step model with validators for timestamps and agent-only fields
- **`subagent_trajectory_ref.py`** — Subagent trajectory reference model
- **`tool_call.py`** — Tool call model
- **`trajectory.py`** — Root trajectory model with validators for step IDs, tool call references, and multimodal content flags

These models provide:

- **Type safety** — All fields are strongly typed using Python type hints
- **Validation** — Automatic validation of required fields, types, and constraints
- **Custom validators** — ISO 8601 timestamp validation, sequential step ID validation, and tool call reference validation
- **JSON serialization** — `.to_json_dict()` method for clean JSON export with optional None exclusion

#### **Trajectory Validator**

The `src/harbor/utils/trajectory_validator.py` module provides a command-line tool and programmatic API for validating ATIF trajectory files:

```bash
# Validate a trajectory file
python -m harbor.utils.trajectory_validator trajectory.json
```

The validator:

- Accepts trajectory data as a dict, JSON string, or file path
- Validates against the complete ATIF schema using Pydantic models
- Collects all validation errors before returning (not just the first error)
- Provides user-friendly error messages with field paths

**Programmatic usage:**

```python
from harbor.utils.trajectory_validator import TrajectoryValidator

validator = TrajectoryValidator()
is_valid = validator.validate("trajectory.json")

if not is_valid:
    for error in validator.get_errors():
        print(f"Error: {error}")
```

#### **Integration in Agents**

The Terminus 2 agent (`src/harbor/agents/terminus_2/terminus_2.py`) demonstrates full integration of ATIF:

- Constructs trajectory steps using Pydantic models throughout the execution
- Tracks token metrics, costs, and logprobs in the `Metrics` model
- Records subagent trajectories with `SubagentTrajectoryRef` for context summarization
- Exports complete trajectories to JSON using the `Trajectory.to_json_dict()` method
- Automatically validates trajectory structure through Pydantic's runtime validation

## **VII. Context Management Convention**

System steps that transform the agent's context window (e.g., mid-trajectory compaction, context pruning, knowledge injection) may declare their transformation semantics using a `context_management` object in `step.extra`. This convention enables consumers to determine context boundaries without relying on producer-specific heuristics.

**Convention fields:**


| Field      | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :--------- | :----- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`     | String | The kind of context transformation. Values: `"compaction"` (prior context compressed into summary), `"pruning"` (older turns removed), `"injection"` (external knowledge added to context). Extensible by producers.                                         |
| `boundary` | String | How the transformation affects the agent's context for subsequent steps. Values: `"replace"` (observation content replaces all prior context), `"append"` (observation content added to existing context), `"truncate"` (prior context trimmed). Extensible. |


**Normative context boundary rule:**

> When a system step has `extra.context_management.boundary = "replace"`, the agent's effective context window for all subsequent steps consists of: (1) the observation content from the boundary step (`observation.results[].content`), and (2) any new turns (user, agent, or system) after the boundary step. Steps preceding the boundary are preserved in the trajectory for auditability but are NOT part of the agent's context window for post-boundary steps. Evaluation tools reconstructing the agent's input context for any post-boundary step MUST use the boundary's observation content, not the pre-boundary steps.

Example (context compaction with boundary):

```json
{
  "step_id": 5,
  "source": "system",
  "message": "Context compaction performed",
  "observation": {
    "results": [
      {
        "content": "Summary: prior conversation covered topic X...",
        "subagent_trajectory_ref": [
          { "trajectory_id": "compact-001", "trajectory_path": null }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "extra": {
    "context_management": {
      "type": "compaction",
      "boundary": "replace"
    }
  }
}
```
