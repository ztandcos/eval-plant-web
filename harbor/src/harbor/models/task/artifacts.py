"""Normalization and validation helpers for artifact entries.

Artifact entries are declared at the task level (``artifacts = [...]`` in
task.toml), the step level (``[[steps]].artifacts``), and the trial level
(job config). One *collection set* is the merged list of entries that a
single collection pass operates on. These helpers validate a collection set
and define the canonical mapping from entries to host paths.
