# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

`rewardkit` is a lightweight grading toolkit for defining and running verifiers to output rewards. It discovers and runs folder-based "rewards" (grading criteria) against an agent's workspace, producing a structured JSON score. It supports two evaluation modes: **programmatic** (Python criterion functions) and **judge-based** (LLM or agent CLI evaluation via `Criterion` objects).

This is a standalone package. Core dependency is `litellm`; optional extras: `documents` (markitdown for common document file types), `image` (Pillow), `all` (both).

## Commands

```bash
# Install (from this directory)
uv sync

# Run all tests
uv run pytest tests/

# Run a single test file or test
uv run pytest tests/unit/test_runner.py
uv run pytest tests/unit/test_runner.py::TestRunner::test_run_programmatic_e2e

# Lint and format
uv run ruff check --fix .
uv run ruff format .
```

Always run `ruff check --fix` and `ruff format` after changes.

## Public API

Everything is exported from `rewardkit/__init__.py`: `run`, `run_multi`, `discover`, `criterion`, `Reward`, `Criterion`, `Score`, `Binary`, `Likert`, `Numeric`, `LLMJudge`, `AgentJudge`, `compare`, `format_comparison`, `format_trajectory`.

CLI entry point: `rewardkit <tests_dirs...> [--workspace /app] [--output /logs/verifier/reward.json]` (via `__main__.py`). Single dir calls `run()`, multiple dirs calls `run_multi()` and prints a comparison table.

## Architecture

Pipeline: **discover → build Rewards → run → output JSON**.

### Discovery (`runner.py`)

`discover(tests_dir, workspace)` recursively scans a tests directory for reward definitions. Two layouts:

- **Nested**: each directory is a scoring group; immediate children are inputs to their parent, while top-level directories remain the public dimensions
- **Flat**: criteria placed directly in the `tests_dir` root (cannot mix with nested)

Each directory can contain:
- **Python files** (`.py`) — executed at import time; criteria are registered via the `Session` context
- **Judge `.toml` files** — declares `[judge]` + `[[criterion]]` for LLM/agent evaluation. The `[judge]` section uses `judge =` to specify either an LLM model name (e.g. `"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6"`) or an agent CLI name (`"claude-code"`, `"codex"`). When `judge =` is an agent, an optional `model =` sets the LLM the agent uses. Agent judges support `isolated = true` in `[judge]`.
- **`reward.toml`** — optional scoring config for the directory it sits in. A top-level `weight` and `[scoring]` configure the local `.py` bucket. One unnamed nested `[[reward]]` aggregates all immediate local inputs and child groups; root `[[reward]]` tables remain named output aggregations. An inline `weights` map overrides input weights at that boundary. Child directories default to weight 1.0, `$checks` names the local bucket, and judge TOMLs use their filename stem. `RewardTomlConfig` validates all keys strictly.

All of these can coexist in the same directory (each judge toml plus the implicit `.py` bucket = one Reward object apiece).

`_load_reward_toml` validates the whole file before discovery decides which declared shapes are active, so typos raise instead of being silently ignored. Bucket-config validation keys off `.py` files being absent, not off zero registered criteria: `_import_py_file` caches modules, so a second `discover()` may legitimately register nothing. A `reward.toml` that is itself a judge TOML (`[judge]` + `[[criterion]]`, since judge TOMLs are classified by content, not filename) is left to the judge path. In nested layout the tests root has no `.py` bucket, so root `weight`/`[scoring]` is rejected.

Directories are imported parent-first so `@criterion(shared=True)` factories are available recursively. The tests root remains special: when it has child directories its `.py` files provide shared factories only, non-shared root criteria raise, and root-level judge TOMLs become top-level groups named after their filename stems.

### Session & Criterion Registration (`session.py`, `criteria/`)

A `ContextVar`-based `Session` collects criterion functions during discovery. Registration via:
- `@criterion` decorator (bare or with `description`/`shared` params) — first param is always `workspace: Path`, remaining become factory params
- Built-in criterion functions in `criteria/` module — each is a `@criterion`-decorated factory, accessed as `criteria.file_exists("hello.txt")`

The `criteria/__init__.py` uses `__getattr__` to resolve all criteria from the global `_factory_registry`, allowing user-defined criteria to override built-ins.

**Adding a new built-in criterion**: Create a module in `criteria/`, decorate the function with `@criterion(description=...)`, then add the module name to `_BUILTIN_MODULES` in `criteria/__init__.py`.

Zero-parameter criteria (only `workspace`) auto-register immediately on import. Parameterized criteria that are defined but never called in a discovery context produce a warning.

### Isolation (`isolation.py`)

Workspace isolation uses overlayfs (Linux). When a criterion or agent judge has `isolated=True`, the workspace is mounted as a read-only lower layer with writes going to a temp upper dir. Falls back to fuse-overlayfs if kernel overlay is unavailable.

### Reward Execution (`reward.py`)

`Reward` holds either callable criteria (programmatic) or `Criterion` objects (judge-based) — these are mutually exclusive and validated in `_validate()`. Programmatic criteria receive `workspace: Path` if their signature accepts it. Each criterion runs as a concurrent async task via `asyncio.TaskGroup`. Concurrency is controlled per-type via semaphores passed to `arun()`.

Score aggregation modes on the `Reward.score` property: `weighted_mean` (default), `all_pass`, `any_pass`, `threshold`, `required_pass`. `required_pass` gates on `Criterion.optional`: it scores 1.0 only when every non-optional score passes; `optional` scores never gate (with no non-optional scores it warns and scores 0.0). Programmatic scores are never optional, so `required_pass` reduces to `all_pass` for programmatic rewards.

### Judge System (`judges.py`)

- **LLMJudge**: calls LiteLLM with criteria-based system prompt, reads workspace files (text + images via base64) into multimodal content blocks, parses structured JSON response. Supports `files`, `reference`, and `atif_trajectory` fields.
- **AgentJudge**: `judges.py` owns provider-independent prompting, retries, parsing, and metadata aggregation. Async `AgentBackend` implementations in `agents.py` own provider lifecycle and return one `AgentAttempt` per execution. RewardKit downloads a pinned Codex CLI into its cache on first use. Codex accepts `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `CODEX_AUTH_JSON`; the API key has priority unless `REWARDKIT_FORCE_SUBSCRIPTION=1`.
- **MCP servers for agent judges**: `MCPServerConfig` mirrors Harbor's task configuration. Codex supports stdio and streamable HTTP servers, including `allowed_tools`, but not `sse`.
- Prompt templates in `src/rewardkit/prompts/` (`llm.md`, `agent.md`, `llm_trajectory.md`); custom templates via `prompt_template` in judge `.toml` (must contain `{criteria}` placeholder)
- Judges use structured outputs generated by `_build_response_schema()`. `parse_judge_response()` extracts JSON from fenced code blocks or raw braces and raises `ValueError` on unparseable responses.
- Agent judge details include normalized token `usage` and copied native JSONL `judge_logs`. Failed Codex attempts also save their stdout and stderr as text logs.

### Trajectory Support (`trajectory.py`)

Formats ATIF (Agent Trajectory Interchange Format) JSON into compact text for judge prompts. Token-budget-aware: truncates individual content blocks proportionally to fit within model context limits. All steps are always preserved; only content within steps gets truncated.

### Multi-dir Comparison (`compare.py`, `run_multi`)

`run_multi()` runs multiple independent test directories and produces namespaced scores (`"dir/reward"`). `compare()` / `format_comparison()` generate a diff table for overlapping reward names across directories.

### Output

`run()` writes to `/logs/verifier/reward.json` (default) with flat per-reward scores:
```json
{"correctness": 0.75, "structure": 1.0, "quality": 0.6}
```

A separate `reward-details.json` is written alongside with per-criterion breakdown including kind (`programmatic`/`llm`/`agent`), judge config, raw judge output, and any warnings.

### Models (`models.py`)

Models are Pydantic `BaseModel`s. Output formats (`Binary`, `Likert`, `Numeric`) implement the `OutputFormat` protocol with `normalize()`, `prompt_fragment()`, and `json_schema()`. The `json_schema()` method returns the JSON Schema fragment for the score field (used by structured output enforcement). `Criterion.name` auto-generates a slug from `description` if not provided. `Criterion.id` is an optional stable rubric identifier (e.g. `"1.1"`) carried through to `Score` and `reward-details.json` for provenance, independent of `name`. `Criterion.negate` (bool) makes `parse_judge_response()` invert the normalized score (`value -> 1 - value`) while keeping the pre-flip judge answer in `Score.raw`. `Criterion.optional` (bool) is carried onto each `Score`, surfaced in `to_dict` only when true, and consumed by the `required_pass` aggregation. As a fallback, rubric metadata nested under an `annotations` table (`type` for negate, `importance` for optional) is mapped to these bools in `_build_criteria_from_toml`.

## Code Conventions

- Use `warnings.warn` (not `logger.warning`) for user-facing warnings about criterion behavior (e.g. out-of-range scores, unexpected formats). This ensures users see the warning even without logging configured.
- **Agent backends are fresh per judge.** The instance may hold session state shared by that judge's sequential attempts (for example, a Codex SDK client), while each `run()` call returns its own `AgentAttempt`. Never use mutable singleton backend state because rewards run concurrently.

## Testing Conventions

- All tests are in `tests/unit/` — no integration tests
- `conftest.py` provides two autouse fixtures:
  - `_fresh_session`: resets session and `_factory_registry` per test (saves/restores registry state)
  - `_fake_overlayfs`: patches `_Overlay.mount` and `_Overlay.cleanup` to simulate overlayfs via `shutil.copytree` — this runs automatically on macOS/non-root where real overlayfs is unavailable
- No special markers needed; all tests run with `pytest`
