The Harbor Rewardkit is a lightweight package to define and run verifiers. Rewardkit is designed to be used with the Harbor task format but you can use it on its own.

## Installation

```bash
uv tool install harbor-rewardkit
```

## Example: Programmatic criteria

```python
# tests/check.py
from rewardkit import criteria

criteria.file_exists("output.txt")
criteria.file_contains("output.txt", "hello")
```

## Example: scoring config for a dimension

Drop a `reward.toml` next to the checks to control how they score. `[scoring]`
gates the group instead of averaging it, and `weight` sets its share of the
dimension when the directory also holds judge tomls:

```toml
# tests/structure/reward.toml
weight = 2.0

[scoring]
aggregation = "all_pass"
```

Directories can be nested into larger groups. A non-root directory may use one
`[[reward]]` table to aggregate its local checks, judges, and immediate child
directories. Child directories default to equal weight; override them with a
short inline map:

```toml
# tests/correctness/reward.toml
[[reward]]
aggregation = "weighted_mean"
weights = { files = 2.0, behavior = 1.0 }
```

At the tests root, named aggregations use the same syntax:

```toml
[[reward]]
name = "reward"
aggregation = "weighted_mean"
weights = { correctness = 2.0, quality = 1.0 }
```

Root-level judge TOMLs also remain valid when dimension directories exist. Each
becomes a top-level score named after its filename stem and may be included in
the root aggregation.

## Example: LLM judge

```toml
# tests/quality.toml
[judge]
judge = "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6"
files = ["/app/main.py"]

[[criterion]]
description = "Is the code correct?"
type = "binary"
```

## Example: Agent judge with an MCP server

Each `[[judge.mcp_servers]]` entry matches a Harbor task's `[[environment.mcp_servers]]`.
Per-server `allowed_tools` lists the tools the judge may call; omit it to allow all of the
server's tools. Codex does not support `sse` servers.

```toml
# tests/quality.toml
[judge]
judge = "claude-code"

[[judge.mcp_servers]]
name = "playwright"
transport = "stdio"
command = "npx"
args = ["@playwright/mcp@latest", "--headless", "--isolated"]
allowed_tools = ["navigate", "click"]

[[criterion]]
description = "Does the rendered page match the spec?"
type = "binary"
```

## Usage

Add rewardkit to your `test.sh` file:

```bash
# tests/test.sh
uvx harbor-rewardkit@0.1 /tests
```
